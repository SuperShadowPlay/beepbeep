# beepbeep
An open-source, discord.py version of the Rythm discord bot.

This is a self-hosted bot, meaning you will have to get
your own bot token and host the program yourself.

Paste your bot's token into the `token.txt` file to send it to the program.

If you do not know what any of this means, visit this link:
https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token

Use b/help to see the commands once the bot is running.
